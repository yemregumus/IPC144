1-) We can use parrallel arrays for group a data related to eachother. Each index of array corresponds->
->to a particular group of information. If we need to give an example considering 2 array;


String[] itemName = {"Potato", "Tomato", "Lemon", "Eggplant"};
int[] itemPrice = {5, 4, 3, 8};

Here at index 0 both arrays stores an information about 4 item. There are total 4 items above, first->
->array stores name of the item and second array stores the price of the item. We can use key to group->
->data. For example, at key 0 both arrays contain information about first item which is Potato for $5->
->Thus key is important and used as index of array to get the data.

2-) In my opinion, it should be a rule to start iteration with 0 because index always starts from 0.
An example from my code from workshop 4;

for (item = 0; item < listSize; item++)

So as we can see item starts from 0, and increments continuing as big as assigned size of listSize. 

3-)I explain it to my 4 years old like this today;

An array is a contiguous space available in memory.Consider a refrigerator having 5 partitions in it->
->for drinks.In computer memory, we can say this refrigerator is an array. Now to know from which rack->
->you need to take out pop or in which partition you will place beer and in which rack you will place->
->water etc we give an integer to every partition. We have a restriction that refrigerator should contain->
->only similar type of stuff like pop, beer or water.In terms of computers, it is called data-types.->
->And we give integer starting from 0 to each partition.

In the end she said; -Daddy, are you a scientist? 

Maybe its too early for her age :)
