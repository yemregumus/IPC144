1-) Mapping the month integer value to the first three characters of the month name could have
been accomplished using switch statements and array. Since we didn't learn arrays while we
do this workshop we were not allowed to use array. 

The code below is a short example;

int main(void)
{
int month = 0;

switch (month)
{
	case 1:
		printf("JAN");
		break;
	case 2:
		printf("FEB");
		break;
	return 0;

}

2-) 3 types of iteration constructs are `for`, `while` and `do-while`. In the first part, I used while
loop and switch statements. In the second part, I used `while loop` to set log date, `for loop` to keep track of log dates and switch statements.

3-) Since we use visual studio I use the local debugger for testing and it gives an error code if there
is a problem, I find the line with the problem and if its a syntax or something basic if i forgot
a semicolon for example I fix it but if it's not something easy I usually google the error and
read lots of forums watching youtube videos to learn how to fix it and the information is usually not relevant
to errors that I get but in the end, I'm finding it in some way researching all day and fix it.
